Linear Search, Binary Search   

Search Alogrithms  
-  Find a value in a data structure;  

Linear search  
-  Traverse the array incrementing index by one (or go to the next element for linked list) and compare against the search value.  
-  Time complexity O(n);  


Binary search  
-  Data must be sorted  
-  Chooses the element in the middle and compares against the search value  
-  Search the left and the right half in the same way  
- Time complexity 0(log2n) â€“keeps dividing the array in half

In the implementation i used a iterative and ar recursive method.  
It is preferable tu use iterative, recursive is more expensive because is overhead involved with method called.
